# Introductory Data Science Tools: Unix and Python

## GAIN program Summer 2023    
**Prof**: Dr. Thomas Parchman; SFB 209; tparchman@unr.edu   
**Workshop hours**: 9:00-11:00 AM, August 20, 21, 


## Workshop Description
Modern biology, and other fields of science, are increasingly shaped by data sets that are orders of magnitude larger than many scientists have traditionally been trained to work with. For example, major recent advances in DNA sequencing technology have created the ability to affordably generate data spanning billions of DNA sequences in an extremely short period of time. Similar leaps in data acquisition technology are transforming other scientific disciplines, including but not limited to geography, communications, economics, chemistry, and physics. Spreadsheet software and graphical user interface statistical analysis packages (e.g., Excel, Statistica, JMP) are useless for this now common scale of data. The ability to manipulate, process, and analyze large data sets with basic programming and data science skills should accelerate the research productivity and success of graduate students in this era. 

This short module will introduce students to basic computational tools, focusing on Unix and Python, to support data proficiency. We will start at the most basic level, assuming zero or limited previous experience, and aim to build enough familiarity for students to feel equipped and motivated to learn more on their own. Our overall goal is to provide an entry point for students to gain further expertise in simple programming and efficient manipulation and analysis of large-scale data sets. As our time together is extremely limited, I aim to introduce you to linux and python, attempting to describe why writing code in these languages is useful. I have attempted to put together fairly easy to follow modules written in markdown so that you have introductory resources available for getting started with Linux and Python. The continued development of proficiency with these and similar skillsets are guaranteed to improve the efficacy and quality pf graduate research and productivity.


## Required Materials

- **Computer with Unix operating system** Students with
  Mac computers already have machines running Unix and
  are ready to go. Students without Mac computers will have the option of checking out a Mac laptop for the semester, or will need to figure out how to install Linux or a Linux emulator on their computer. 

- **Installed text editor with syntax recognition** Students should install a text editor that will recognize syntax from code written for Unix, Python, Perl, etc. I suggest BBedit (for mac users), Visual Studio Code, or Sublime. All are free and easy to locate, download, and install.

- **Supplemental primers, tutorials, and other materials** are provided on the [workshop github page](https://github.com/tparchman/GAIN_2023).

### Suggested resources for more in depth learning
* **Practical computing for biologists** Haddock, S.H.D. and Dunn, C.W., 2011. Sunderland, MA, USA: Sinauer Associates. The book is very useful for both Unix and Python.

# Python documentation and other useful resources

## Workshop Format
We will meet from 9:00-11:00 on August 21st and 22nd. At the beginning of each session, we will introduce new concepts and material that will form the basis of the markdown primers I provide for introductory tutorials or exercises. We will cover questions or discussion, and then students will spend at least half of each period working through the primers independently or in small groups. Given limited time, I at least hope that these primers may serve a somewhat useful introduction for those wanting to learn more.

## Workshop Material Organization

The material for each day of the workshop will be organized in separate directories on [workshop github page](https://github.com/tparchman/GAIN_2023). Each of these directories will contain the slides that we will use to introduce material, a primer covering example Unix, Python, and R code along with explanations, and a number of programming practice exercises. There are also general directories on the repository with supplementary resources for Unix and Python, including cheat sheets, tutorials, and recommended resources for learning more.

### Downloading material from github using `git`

While you can download indidvidual files from github using your preferred web browser, you can also use the UNIX command line to access github far more usefully. Although using git commands can get complicated, it is a very useful skill to have for reproducibility, tracking changes, and collaboration. We do not go over git in this course but there are many tutorials online (http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/). 

For this course, downloading individual files might suffice. But if you would like to download the entire repo, you can do so through the command line using the below command:

**hint:** make a directory somewhere on your computer for this workshop. Run below command in that directory from the linux/unix terminal.

```
git clone https://github.com/tparchman/GAIN_2023
```
