    "\n",
    "The idea of this course is to introduce scientists without any, or much, prior programming experience to a language that can be useful for their needs. The choice of the first programming language to learn may not be as important as you think; once you have learned one, learning additional languages will be much much easier, and you are nearly guaranteed to utilize additional languages at some point in your career. There are a number of reasons that Python has become the ideal language to learn first for data science:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is one of the most common languages used in biology and other fields of science. Thus, you will be able to find a lot of documentation, guidance, examples, and opinion on the web.\n",
    "- It has excellent capabilities for manipulating text, suiting it well to bioinformatics and data science.\n",
    "- It uses consistent syntax, which makes learning specific code relatively easy.\n",
    "- It has many built in libraries to facilitate common tasks.\n",
    "- Python is very widely used, across science and inustry. \n",

    "# 1. Installing/updating to python 3 current version\n",
    "We are going to start slow and basic with Python, attempting to insure that everyone stays on board. First we are going to make sure everyone has the most recent version installed on their machine. While doing this, we are going to take a slight detour to learn how incredibly easy it can be to download and install packages for Unix commands or programs that are not installed in the base system. For this, we will demonstrate the use of `brew`, which is command line utility for locating, downloading, and installing Unix packages on Mac computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "First check to see if you have python3 installed.  Open the shell and type\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ python --version\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get anyting that looks like version 2 not 3 or if you get an error that you dont have python. Then you will need to install version 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing or updating Python on Mac Unix using homebrew\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have already installed Homebrew - you dont need to do this. Check if you have it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ which brew\n",
    "  \n",
    "If you dont have `brew`, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ /usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Then install python3 \n",
    "\n",
    "    $ brew install python3\n",
    "\n",
    "**For more depth on homebrew and using the `brew` command to install and update packages in your Unix system, see section 7 of  [unixII_primer.md](https://github.com/tparchman/GAIN_summer2021/tree/main/day_one/unixII_primer.md).\n",

    "# 2. Writing your first python program\n",
    "\n",
    "As with shell scripts, the first line of python scripts should be the shebang followed by the location of python:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #!/usr/local/bin/python3\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are unsure where you installed python3, you can easily figure out where it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ which python3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As covered in Haddock and Dunn, pg 127, you can also use the below as your first line. This allows you to send script to `env` first, which should then locate python3, wherever it resides.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #!/usr/bin/env python3\n",
    "\n",
    "Either of the above will do, and are important **IF** or when you wish to convert your scripts to executable. If you want to do this, change the file mode: \n",
    "\n",
    "    $ chmod u+x first_python.py\n",
    "\n",
    "And run as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ ./first_python.py\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your first simple program, using a `print` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sending information from your python scripts to stdout is accomplished with the `print` statement. Our first script will simply illustrate how we print specified text, and will serve to convince you that writing python code might not be that hard. Use `touch` to make a blank text file, but give it a `.py` extension as is customary for python scripts. This script needs only two simple parts. First, your customary first line that should go in all of your scripts, which should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #!/usr/bin/env python3\n",
    "Or the path to the specific location where python lives:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #!/usr/local/bin/python3\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the use of `comment` text, marked with `#`, lets add a comment that is for you to read, not python. \n",
    "\n",
    "    #this is a comment: testing my first program with a simple print statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the line above will not be part of the interpreted code. Instead, you can make use of `#` to leave annotations for yourself or others in your code to explain what you are doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets add a print statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"Im ready to learn python, and this is my first step\")\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now run your program in two ways. Simply (which we strongly recommend for this class):\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ python3 first_script.py \n",
    "\n",
    "Or, change to executable, then run:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ chmod u+x first_script.py\n",
    "    $ ./first_script.py\n",
    "\n",
    "If all is in order, \"Im ready to learn python, and this is my first step\" should print to the screen, and you are ready for more.\n",
    "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "# `#`: comment character, annotating your code.\n",
    "Anytime you use `#`, the rest of the line will be 'commented out'. This means python won't interpret what you write, and that you can write notes or annotations on what your code is doing, to help yourself and others. Make heavy use of this, and when you go back to old or strange code, you will know why you did what you did. When others make good use of this, you can learn more about why/how they did what they did. Use `#` frequently, especially in the early phases of learning python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In example code below and in other primers, I have put comments to describe some code using `#`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    print (\"This is python code\")  # this is a comment to describe the left\n",

    "# 3. Working with scalars (strings, integers, floats, etc.)\n",
    "Chapter 8 of Haddock and Dunn does a nice job of walking you through a script that codes and performs various actions on strings and integers (both types of scalar variables). Lets use that example to cover a few aspects of working with strings and integers in python, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- some useful built-in string functions\n",
    "- basic mathematical operations\n",
    "- using the interactive prompt to test simple code, get help, etc. (`help()`, `dir()`)\n",
    "- controlling string formatting with `%`\n",
